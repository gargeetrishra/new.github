            <P class="A"><h2>Nanotechnology is the engineering of functional systems at the molecular scale. This covers both current work and concepts that are more advanced. In its original sense, nanotechnology refers to the projected ability to construct items from the bottom up, using techniques and tools being developed today to make complete, high performance products.</h2></P></class>
            <H2><u>Defining Nanotechnology based on size</u></H2>
             <p><big> Nanotechnology as defined by size is naturally broad, including fields of science as diverse as surface science, organic chemistry, molecular biology, semiconductor physics, energy storage,engineering, microfabrication, and molecular engineering. The associated research and applications are equally diverse, ranging from extensions of conventional device physics to completely new approaches based upon molecular self-assembly, from developing new materials with dimensions on the nanoscale to direct control of matter on the atomic scale.</big></p>
		    <H2><u>Origins of Nanotechnology</u></H2>
		     <p><big>The term "nano-technology" was first used by Norio Taniguchi in 1974, though it was not widely known. Inspired by Feynman's concepts, K. Eric Drexler used the term "nanotechnology" in his 1986 book Engines of Creation: The Coming Era of Nanotechnology, which proposed the idea of a nanoscale "assembler" which would be able to build a copy of itself and of other items of arbitrary complexity with atomic control. Also in 1986, Drexler co-founded The Foresight Institute (with which he is no longer affiliated) to help increase public awareness and understanding of nanotechnology concepts and implications.If you want this summary completely, then click on the link below.</big></p>

		    <H2><u>Fundamental concepts of Nanotechnology</u></H2>
		     <p><BIG>One nanometer (nm) is one billionth, or 10−9, of a meter. By comparison, typical carbon-carbon bond lengths, or the spacing between these atoms in a molecule, are in the range 0.12–0.15 nm, and a DNA double-helix has a diameter around 2 nm. On the other hand, the smallest cellular life-forms, the bacteria of the genus Mycoplasma, are around 200 nm in length. By convention, nanotechnology is taken as the scale range 1 to 100 nm following the definition used by the National Nanotechnology Initiative in the US. The lower limit is set by the size of atoms (hydrogen has the smallest atoms, which are approximately a quarter of a nm kinetic diameter) since nanotechnology must build its devices from atoms and molecules. The upper limit is more or less arbitrary but is around the size below which phenomena not observed in larger structures start to become apparent and can be made use of in the nano device. These new phenomena make nanotechnology distinct from devices which are merely miniaturised versions of an equivalent macroscopic device; such devices are on a larger scale and come under the description of microtechnology.</BIG></p>

		    <h2><u>Effects of Nanotechnology on Health and Sanitation</u></h2>
		     <p><big>Nanotechnology is already useful as a tool in health care research. In January 2005, researchers at the US Massachusetts Institute of Technology used 'optical tweezers' - pairs of tiny glass beads are brought together or moved apart using laser beams - to study the elasticity of red blood cells that are infected with the malaria parasite (see Tiny tools tackle malaria). The technique is helping researchers to better understand how malaria spreads through the body.</big></p>
		    <h2><u>Concerns About Possible Effects on Human and Environmental Health</u></h2>
			 <p><big>Others, however, are as cautious as Smalley is enthusiastic. Eric Drexler, the scientist who coined the term nanotechnology, has warned of developing "extremely powerful, extremely dangerous technologies". In his book Engines of Creation, Drexler envisioned that self-replicating molecules created by humans might escape our control. Although this theory has been widely discredited by researchers in the field, many concerns remain regarding the effects of nanotechnology on human and environmental health as well as the effect the new industry could have on the North-South divide. Activists worry that the science and development of nanotechnology will progress faster than policy-makers can devise appropriate regulatory measures. They say an informed debate must take place to determine the balance between risks and benefits.</big></p>
            <h2><u>What are the Experts Saying About Nanotechnology?</u></h2>
			 <p><big>In June 1999, Richard Smalley, Nobel laureate in chemistry, addressed the US House Committee on Science on the benefits of nanotechnology. "The impact of nanotechnology on the health, wealth, and lives of people," he said, "will be at least the equivalent of the combined influences of microelectronics, medical imaging, computer-aided engineering and man-made polymers developed in this century."</big></p>

			  <h3>Abstract</h3>
			  <p><big>Nanotechnology has shown promising potential to promote sustainable agriculture. This article reviews the recent developments on applications of nanotechnology in agriculture including crop production and protection with emphasis on nanofertilizers, nanopesticides, nanobiosensors and nano-enabled remediation strategies for contaminated soils. Nanomaterials play an important role regarding the fate, mobility and toxicity of soil pollutants and are essential part of different biotic and abiotic remediation strategies. Efficiency and fate of nanomaterials is strongly dictated by their properties and interactions with soil constituents which is also critically discussed in this review. Investigations into the remediation applications and fate of nanoparticles in soil remain scarce and are mostly limited to laboratory studies. Once entered in the soil system, nanomaterials may affect the soil quality and plant growth which is discussed in context of their effects on nutrient release in target soils, soil biota, soil organic matter and plant morphological and physiological responses. The mechanisms involved in uptake and translocation of nanomaterials within plants and associated defense mechanisms have also been discussed. Future research directions have been identified to promote the research into sustainable development of nano-enabled agriculture.</big></p>

			<h2><u>Nanobiotechnology</u></h2>
			 <p><big>Nanotechnology is a recently coined term describing the convergence of the two existing but distant worlds of engineering and molecular biology. Nanobiotechnology is the interface between nanotechnology and biology. This is a combination of three words: NANO is tiny, BIO is living things, and TECHNOLOGY is about tools. It is an emerging area of scientific and technological advancement. Nanobiotechnology refers to the ability to create and manipulate biological and biochemical materials, devices, and systems at atomic and molecular levels (billionth of a meter). Thus, it is an integration of physical sciences, molecular engineering, biology, chemistry, and biotechnology, and holds considerable promise of advances in pharmaceuticals and health care. Nanomaterials are at the leading edge of the rapidly developing field of nanotechnology. Their unique size-dependent properties make these materials superior, indispensable in many areas of human activity, and above all a tiny tool to learn about living things. Consequently it applies the tools and processes of nano/microfabrication to build devices for studying biosystems. In nanobiotechnology, big things are expected from really small things. Hence biological tests measuring the presence or activity of selected substances, for targeted delivery become quicker, more sensitive and more flexible when certain nanoscale particles are put to work as tags or labels. To this end, advancement in nanobiotechnology has proved beneficial for both diagnostic (imaging) and novel therapies such as drug discovery, drug delivery, gene/vaccine delivery, and tissue engineering.</big></p>
			 
			<h2><u>What About Nanotechnology in the Developing World?</u></h2>
			 <p><big>In the developing world, Brazil, Chile, China, India, the Philippines, South Korea, South Africa and Thailand have shown their commitment to nanotechnology by establishing government-funded programmes and research institutes. Researchers at the University of Toronto Joint Centre for Bioethics have classified these countries as 'front-runners' (China, South Korea, India) and 'middle ground' players (Thailand, Philippines, South Africa, Brazil, Chile). In addition, Argentina and Mexico are 'up and comers': although they have research groups studying nanotechnology, their governments have not yet organised dedicated funding.</big></p>
			<h2><u>Nanoelectronics- Nanotechnology in Electronics</u></h2>
			 <p><big>The term nanoelectronics refers to the use of nanotechnology in electronic components. These components are often only a few nanometers in size. However, the tinier electronic components become, the harder they are to manufacture.<br>
			      <br>
Nanoelectronics covers a diverse set of devices and materials, with the common characteristic that they are so small that physical effects alter the materials'properties on a nanoscale – inter-atomic interactions and quantum mechanical properties play a significant role in the workings of these devices. At the nanoscale, new phenomena take precedence over those that hold sway in the macro-world. Quantum effects such as tunneling and atomistic disorder dominate the characteristics of these nanoscale devices.<br>
                  <br>
The first transistors built in 1947 were over 1 centimeter in size; the smallest working transistor today is 7 nanometers long – over 1.4 million times smaller (1 cm equals 10 million nanometers). The result of these efforts are billion-transistor processors where, once industry embraces 7nm manufacturing techniques, 20 billion transistor-based circuits are integrated into a single chip.
              <h3>Nanoelectronic Devices</h3>
			    <p><big><strong>Spintronics</strong><br>
Besides transistors, nanoelectronic devices play a role in data storage (memory). Here, spintronics – the study and exploitation in solid-state devices of electron spin and its associated magnetic moment, along with electric charge – is already an established technology.</big></p>
                    
				
                    <img src="https://www.nanowerk.com/nanotechnology-news/id39960.jpg" alt="Illustration of electron spin in a graphene lattice" height="300px" width="350px">
			  <br>
			    <p><big>Spintronics also plays a role in new technologies that exploit quantum behavior for computing.</big></p>
				<br>
				<p><big><strong>Optoelectronics</strong><br>
				Electronic devices that source, detect and control light – i.e. optoelectronic devices – come in many shapes and forms. Highly energy-efficient (less heat generation and power consumption) optical communications are increasingly important because they have the potential to solve one of the biggest problems of our information age: energy consumption.</big></p>
				<h3>Wearable, flexible electronics</h3>
				<p><big>The age of wearable electronics is upon us as witnessed by the fast growing array of smart watches, fitness bands and other advanced, next-generation health monitoring devices such as electronic stick-on tattoos.
				<br>
If current research is an indicator, wearable electronics will go far beyond just very small electronic devices or wearable, flexible computers. Not only will these devices be embedded in textile substrates but an electronics device or system could ultimately become the fabric itself. Electronic textiles (e-textiles) will allow the design and production of a new generation of garments with distributed sensors and electronic functions. Such e-textiles will have the revolutionary ability to sense, act, store, emit, and move – think biomedical monitoring functions or new man-machine interfaces – while ideally leveraging an existing low-cost textile manufacturing infrastructure (see for instance "wearing single-walled carbon nanotube electronics on your skin", a "temporary tattoo to monitor glucose levels" or "graphene nanosensor tattoo on teeth monitors bacteria in your mouth").</big></p>

			<h2><u>Nanotechnology in Food Processing</u></h2>
			 <p><big>The nanostructured food ingredients are being developed with the claims that they offer improved taste, texture, and consistency (Cientifica Report, 2006). Nanotechnology increasing the shelf-life of different kinds of food materials and also help brought down the extent of wastage of food due to microbial infestation (Pradhan et al., 2015). Nowadays nanocarriers are being utilized as delivery systems to carry food additives in food products without disturbing their basic morphology. Particle size may directly affect the delivery of any bioactive compound to various sites within the body as it was noticed that in some cell lines, only submicron nanoparticles can be absorbed efficiently but not the larger size micro-particles (Ezhilarasi et al., 2013). An ideal delivery system is supposed to have following properties: (i) able to deliver the active compound precisely at the target place (ii) ensure availability at a target time and specific rate, and (iii) efficient to maintain active compounds at suitable levels for long periods of time (in storage condition). Nanotechnology being applied in the formation of encapsulation, emulsions, biopolymer matrices, simple solutions, and association colloids offers efficient delivery systems with all the above-mentioned qualities. Nano polymers are trying to replace conventional materials in food packaging. Nanosensors can be used to prove the presence of contaminants, mycotoxins, and microorganisms in food (Bratovčić, 2015).<br>
			        <br>
					
			         Nanoparticles have better properties for encapsulation and release efficiency than traditional encapsulation systems. Nanoencapsulations mask odors or tastes, control interactions of active ingredients with the food matrix, control the release of the active agents, ensure availability at a target time and specific rate, and protect them from moisture, heat (Ubbink and Kruger, 2006), chemical, or biological degradation during processing, storage, and utilization, and also exhibit compatibility with other compounds in the system (Weiss et al., 2006). Moreover, these delivery systems possess the ability to penetrate deeply into tissues due to their smaller size and thus allow efficient delivery of active compounds to target sites in the body (Lamprecht et al., 2004). Various synthetic and natural polymer-based encapsulating delivery systems have been elaborated for the improved bioavailability and preservation of the active food components (Table 1). Further, the importance of nanotechnology in food processing can be evaluated by considering its role in the improvement of food products in terms of (i) food texture, (ii) food appearance, (iii) food taste, (iv) nutritional value of the food, and (v) food shelf-life. It is a matter of fact that surprisingly nanotechnology not only touches all the above-mentioned aspects but has also brought about significant alterations in food products providing them novel qualities.
					 <br><strong>Nanotechnology is also used in food packaging.</strong></big></p>

			<center><h2><u>Five ways nanotechnology is securing your future</h2></u></center>
                     <ol>			
                        <h2><li><u> Doctors inside your body</u></li></h2>
                          <p><big>Wearable fitness technology means we can monitor our health by strapping gadgets to ourselves. There are even prototype electronic tattoos that can sense our vital signs. But by scaling down this technology, we could go further by implanting or injecting tiny sensors inside our bodies. This would capture much more detailed information with less hassle to the patient, enabling doctors to personalise their treatment.</big></p>
					       <img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2016/1-fivewaysnano.jpg" alt="Doctor inside your body" height="300px" width="300px"><br>
						   
						   <p><big>The possibilities are endless, ranging from monitoring inflammation and post-surgery recovery to more exotic applications whereby electronic devices actually interfere with our body's signals for controlling organ function. Although these technologies might sound like a thing of the far future, multi-billion healthcare firms such as GlaxoSmithKline are already working on ways to develop so-called "electroceuticals".</big></p>
						<h2><li><u>Sensors, sensors, everywhere</u></li></h2>
						  <p><big>These sensors rely on newly-invented nanomaterials and manufacturing techniques to make them smaller, more complex and more energy efficient. For example, sensors with very fine features can now be printed in large quantities on flexible rolls of plastic at low cost. This opens up the possibility of placing sensors at lots of points over critical infrastructure to constantly check that everything is running correctly. Bridges, aircraft and even nuclear power plants could benefit.</big></p>
					        <img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2016/2-fivewaysnano.jpg" alt="Sensors, sensors, everywhere" height="300px" width="300px">
						<h2><li><u>Self-healing structures</u></li></h2>
						  <p><big>If cracks do appear then nanotechnology could play a further role. Changing the structure of materials at the nanoscale can give them some amazing properties – by giving them a texture that repels water, for example. In the future, nanotechnology coatings or additives will even have the potential to allow materials to "heal" when damaged or worn. For example, dispersing nanoparticles throughout a material means that they can migrate to fill in any cracks that appear. This could produce self-healing materials for everything from aircraft cockpits to microelectronics, preventing small fractures from turning into large, more problematic cracks.</big></p>
						<h2><li><u>Making big data possible</u></li></h2>
						  <p><big>All these sensors will produce more information than we've ever had to deal with before – so we'll need the technology to process it and spot the patterns that will alert us to problems. The same will be true if we want to use the "big data" from traffic sensors to help manage congestion and prevent accidents, or prevent crime by using statistics to more effectively allocate police resources.</big></p>
					       <img src="https://scx1.b-cdn.net/csz/news/800/2016/3-fivewaysnano.jpg" alt="Making big data possible" height="300px" width="300px"><br>
						   
						  <p><big>Here, nanotechnology is helping to create ultra-dense memory that will allow us to store this wealth of data. But it's also providing the inspiration for ultra-efficient algorithms for processing, encrypting and communicating data without compromising its reliability. Nature has several examples of big-data processes efficiently being performed in real-time by tiny structures, such as the parts of the eye and ear that turn external signals into information for the brain.</big></p><br>
						  <p><big>Computer architectures inspired by the brain could also use energy more efficiently and so would struggle less with excess heat – one of the key problems with shrinking electronic devices further.</big></p>
                        <h2><li><u>Tackling climate change</u></li></h2>
						  <p><big>The fight against climate change means we need new ways to generate and use electricity, and nanotechnology is already playing a role. It has helped create batteries that can store more energy for electric cars and has enabled solar panels to convert more sunlight into electricity.</big></p><br>
                          <p><big>The common trick in both applications is to use nanotexturing or nanomaterials (for example nanowires or carbon nanotubes) that turn a flat surface into a three-dimensional one with a much greater surface area. This means that there is more space for the reactions that enable energy storage or generation to take place, so the devices operate more efficiently</big></p><br>
                          <p><big>In the future, nanotechnology could also enable objects to harvest energy from their environment. New nano-materials and concepts are currently being developed that show potential for producing energy from movement, light, variations in temperature, glucose and other sources with high conversion efficiency.</big></p>						  
					     </ol>
					    <h2><u>Regulation</u></h2>
						  <p><big>Calls for tighter regulation of nanotechnology have occurred alongside a growing debate related to the human health and safety risks of nanotechnology. There is significant debate about who is responsible for the regulation of nanotechnology. Some regulatory agencies currently cover some nanotechnology products and processes (to varying degrees) – by "bolting on" nanotechnology to existing regulations – there are clear gaps in these regimes. Davies (2008) has proposed a regulatory road map describing steps to deal with these shortcomings.
						   <br>
					       <br>
						    Stakeholders concerned by the lack of a regulatory framework to assess and control risks associated with the release of nanoparticles and nanotubes have drawn parallels with bovine spongiform encephalopathy ("mad cow" disease), thalidomide, genetically modified food, nuclear energy, reproductive technologies, biotechnology, and asbestosis. Dr. Andrew Maynard, chief science advisor to the Woodrow Wilson Center's Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies, concludes that there is insufficient funding for human health and safety research, and as a result there is currently limited understanding of the human health and safety risks associated with nanotechnology. As a result, some academics have called for stricter application of the precautionary principle, with delayed marketing approval, enhanced labelling and additional safety data development requirements in relation to certain forms of nanotechnology.
						   <br>
					       <br>
						    The Royal Society report identified a risk of nanoparticles or nanotubes being released during disposal, destruction and recycling, and recommended that "manufacturers of products that fall under extended producer responsibility regimes such as end-of-life regulations publish procedures outlining how these materials will be managed to minimize possible human and environmental exposure".
						   <br>
						   <br>
						    The Center for Nanotechnology in Society has found that people respond to nanotechnologies differently, depending on application – with participants in public deliberations more positive about nanotechnologies for energy than health applications – suggesting that any public calls for nano regulations may differ by technology sector.</big></p>
